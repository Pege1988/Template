## Installation notes
Working directory is identified in script to distinguish between TEST and PROD environment (i.e. local vs network (SYNOLOGY)). 
Once dev and tests finished, store updated/new file(s) and folder(s) on Synology NAS.
For integration testing purposes, run script manually on Synology and check results.
